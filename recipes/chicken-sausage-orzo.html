    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>There's something extra satisfying about a recipe like this one-pot 
        chicken and sausage orzo dish where you just basically dump the 
        ingredients in a pot and wait until it's cooked. Sure, you have to 
        stir it a few times, and it helps if you add stuff in the right order. 
        But for how delicious this comes out, you're doing very little actual 
        work. </p>
