    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>One of the secrets to perfect Italian pasta is to finish cooking 
        the pasta in the sauce. If you master and understand this dish, 
        you will understand the art of Italian pastas and pasta sauces 
        which is all about putting very simple ingredients together in 
        just the right way. Try using my Fresh Garden Tomato Sauce (see 
        Notes).</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces guanciale</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 ounces rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups fresh tomato sauce</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 ounces finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Cut guanciale into 1-inch by 1/8-inch strips.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a saucepan. Add guanciale 
            and cook until well browned and fully rendered, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            Turn off the heat and use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a 
            bowl. Leave all fat in the pan.</li>
        <li>Start pasta: Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a 
            boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
            until not quite done, about 10 minutes. You want it undercooked by 
            at least 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>At the same time, add wine to the guanciale fat in the saucepan. 
            Place over medium-high heat and cook for about 1 minute. 
            Stir in tomato sauce and pepper; bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Transfer the almost fully-cooked pasta into the sauce using a 
            slotted spoon; it's okay if some water gets in the sauce. Add 
            guanciale and stir to combine. Season with salt. Cook and stir 
            until pasta absorbs the sauce and finishes cooking, and the sauce 
            thickens up, about 3 minutes. If the sauce gets too thick, add a 
            splash of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and add some of the Pecorino cheese. Stir 
            until melted, then repeat until all cheese has been added.</li>
        <li>Ladle into 2 bowls and serve.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Chef's Notes</h3>

    <p>If you can't find guanciale, use pancetta. Use any pasta shape you like.</p>

    <p>For best results, use with my <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/285466/fresh-garden-tomato-sauce/">Fresh Garden Tomato Sauce</a>, or pureed San Marzano tomatoes.</p>

    <p>Using wine is optional, but it adds a subtle acidity that will help cut through the richness of the dish.</p>
